# Jet_ML_Tools

A collection of code that grew out of [1612.01551](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01551). Contains python code for creating jet images from an event record and running a convolutional neural net to do quark/gluon discrimination.

Python code should be run from the `python/` directory using python 3 (version 3.5 has been the most extensively tested). 

The `src/` directory contains event generation code. Take a look at the beginning of `Events.cc` for options.
